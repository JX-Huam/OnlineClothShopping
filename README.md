# Online Cloth Shopping

This is a project done by a group of four with me as the leader.

# Programming languages and Tools used
- HTML (Shopping page layout)
- CSS (Beautify the shopping page)
- PHP (Establishing seamless connections with databases, doing server side programming)
- MySQL (cooperate with PHP to access, modify, update tables and datas in databases)

# Type of users
1. Administrator
- Admin is able to manage cloth lists like adding, editing and removing clothes from the lists.
- Admin has the authority to delete any unwanted feedback made by the customers from the database.
- Admin can track order status by checking the order list. It will show the delivery status and can be deleted once delivered.

2. Customers
- Customers can register an account before proceeding to shop using the website.
- If changes want to be made later on, customers can simply click on the ‘Update information’ button.
- Customers can add anything they like into the cart and see what they have chosen in the ‘View cart’ function.
- For whatever problem that might arise, there is a feedback page for the customers to further lodge complaints.
